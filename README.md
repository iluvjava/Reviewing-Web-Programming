# Reviewing-Web-Programming
Let's Review some of of the basics of web development over the summer. 



## Intro: ##
* this is a repo that teaches web programming, just read through the files in the folder and learn them. 
* I will take reference from that CSE 154 from UW and use their courses over the years. 
* I will also take random references from the internet. 
* This repo is public but it's intended to share among acquantances and friends around me.

## How to Code ##
* Use VS-Code for web programming, please go ahead and download it on your PC. You may use editor but this is what I assume people are using for web programming.
